Hi there! 
My name is Jessica. 
I'm particularly interested in the digital world. 
I'm currently training at SAYNA ACADEMY with the aim of broadening my knowledge of web professions, in particular: full-stack developer, web copywriting and everything that revolves around digital marketing. My goals: to become an expert in the web world and contribute to a more digitalized world where everyone is connected.
